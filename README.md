## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze customer churn behavior using data mining techniques.
- Build predictive models for churn classification.
- Implement a BI solution using SSAS.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: Data processing, visualization, and model training.
- **Excel**: Data exploration and basic statistics.
- **SSAS**: For OLAP and data modeling.
- **SSIS**: For making cube and connecting to SQL database.
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib** (assumed): For EDA and machine learning in the notebook.

## 📈 Features

- Churn prediction using supervised learning.
- SSAS cube modeling for business intelligence insights.
- Data visualization and reporting.
